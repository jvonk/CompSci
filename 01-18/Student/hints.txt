Hint for Part A:
Get the substring of the first word from 0 to middle
Get the substring of the 2nd word from middle to the end.
Combine them to a new string and return it.


Hint for Part B
Create a string array called newWords that has the same length as the words array passed in.
Go through each item of the newWords using a loop
    if the index is even (this means we will recombine the current with next)
        set newWords at that location to the result calling the method recombine and passing in words[i] and words[i+1]
    else (this means we will recombine the current with previous)
        set newWords at that location to the result calling the method recombine and passing in words[i] and words[i-1]
return newWords
