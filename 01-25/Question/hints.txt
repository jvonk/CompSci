Hint for Part A:
Using a for-loop, go through spaces.
	If spaces[i] is not null and space[i].getName is equals to the name passed in
		then Return the location which is i
		
Return -1 because the loop did not find anything.

Hint for Part B:
Create a new Horse array of the same size as spaces
Call it newBarn.

Using a for-loop, go through the spaces array.
	Create an int called newIndex=0 to track the index of newBarn..
	If space[i] is not null, then set
		newBarn[newIndex] = space[i].
		Increment newIndex. 

Set the spaces array to the newBarn array.

Or

Using a for loop, go through each spaces from 0 to length-1 using 
	If the space at i is null
		Go through spaces from i+1 to find the next location that is not null
			Then swap it with i
