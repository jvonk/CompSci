Part A:
if the row is at the top or bottom or if the colum is the far left or far right
	then return temps[row][col]
else
	get the sum of the cell above, below, left, and right of temps[row][col],
	divide that by 4, and return the result

Part B:
Create a boolean variable called withinTolerance and set it to true
Create a new 2D array called newTemps of the same size as temps.  
(e.g. double[][] newTemps = new double[temps.length][temps[0].length]; )
Go through the 2D array of temps using a nested for loop
	given r and c from the loops, set newTemps[r][c] to computeTemp(r,c)
	if the absolute value of the difference between temps[r][c] and newTemps[r][c]
	is greater than the tolerance
		set withinTolerance to false
Outside the nested for loop, set temps to newTemps
return withinTolerance
