Part A:
create a counter and set it to 0
go through the pixelValues 2D array
	if the value of it is WHITE or 255
		increment the counter
return the counter


Part B:
Go through the pixelValues 2D array
check if row+2 and col+2 are within bounds of the 2D Array
	get the value of current pixelValue subtracted by the pixelValues at r+2,c+2
	if the result is less than zero
		set it to zero or BLACK
