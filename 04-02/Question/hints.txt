Part A.
Instantiate view with new 2d array with the given numRows and numCols.
Create a count variable and set it to 0.
Go through each row of the view 2d array using a for loop
	If the row number is even,
		go through the col from 0 to the end
		set the view 2d array at the current row and col to scanned[count]
		increment count
	else
		go through the col from end to zero
		set the view 2d array at the current row and col to scanned[count]
		increment count	

		
Part B
Create a total variable
Go through the view 2D array given the startRow to endRow
	Go through the view 2D array given the startcol to endCol
		add the value of each location to total
Divide total by the number of slots calculated by the dimensions above. 
The above will get you the average.  Return it.
